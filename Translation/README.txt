First of all thank yor for looking at these files in consideration to help translate Kerbal Planetary Base System into your language!

HOT TO TRANSLATE
    To create a translation for your language, make a copy of the files "en-us.cfg" and "KSPedia_en.cfg" and name them accordingly to your language:
    - "es-es.cfg" and "KSPedia_es-es.cfg" for spanish
    - "es-mx.cfg" and "KSPedia_es-mx.cfg" for mexican spanish
    - "ja.cfg" and "KSPedia_ja.cfg" for japanese
    - "ru.cfg" and "KSPedia_ru.cfg" for russian
    - "zh-cn.cfg" and "KSPedia_zh-cn.cfg" for simplified chinese

    Then change the language tag in the third line of the copy of the "en-us.cfg" to the tag of your language.
    Again:
    - "es-es" for spanish
    - "es-mx" for mexican spanish
    - "ja" for japanese
    - "ru" for russian
    - "zh-cn" for simplified chinese

Finally translate all the string after the "=" signs.
    e.g. 
      #LOC_KPBS.filtersettings.name = Filter Settings
    to
      #LOC_KPBS.filtersettings.name = Настройки фильтра

WHAT NOT TO TRANSLATE
    There are some texts in here that should not be translated into another language and be kept in the files

    1. any word that start with cck-XXX, e.g. cck-lifesupport. These are tags to sort the parts into categories by the Community Category Kit.
    2. control sequences like '\n', '\t' or similar.
    3. HTML Tags like <b>...</b>, <i>...</i> or

And once again, thank you for helping translate this mod!
